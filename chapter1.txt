W≈çdanaz was associated with war, death, wisdom, poetry, and magic, and was considered the god of the elite and the ruler of the afterlife. But that's not how I see him... to me he's always
been this weird mysterious figure that I have to call dad. We're not particularly close or anything I mean I guess it's hard for a god but that's always seemed weird to me.
