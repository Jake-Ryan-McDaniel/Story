Both W≈çdanaz and Odin have a connection potentially to the oldest form or well the oldest known form of what is known today as the wild hunt. Which I know the wild hunt in a different way
than most. To me the wild hunt is more of a force within the world. Something else that may seem a bit odd about this force is that it just releases offspring. and No it doesn't work how
you think. I am the offspring of the wild hunt. what supposedly happend is that my parents accidentily left me out during a storm and the force took pity on me or whatever the force feels?
After that I was taken by cps, cause ya know pretty neglectful parents.
